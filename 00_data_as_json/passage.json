Let us identify with the persons of whose grievous, undeserved, and lamentable misfortunes we complain; let us not plead the case as though it were someone else\u2019s, but take the pain of it on ourselves for the moment. We shall thus say what we would have said in similar circumstances of our own. I have frequently seen tragic and comic actors, having taken off their masks at the end of some emotional scene, leave the stage still in tears.17 And if the mere delivery of the written words of another can so kindle them with imagined emotions, what shall we be capable of doing, we who have to imagine the facts in such a way that we can feel vicariously the emotions of our endangered clients?",

It is mentioned in Alfred Harbage's Annals of English Drama: 975-1700 (263) and may have been written by a Cambridge undergraduate or don for performance on a holiday or festive occasion. The action revolves about some brisk undergraduates whose notion of sophistication is to skip college chapel in order to breakfast at leisure, and later to play tennis, reserving the afternoon for cards and sipping \"rack-punch\" spiced with lemon juice. In scene 1, an undergraduate named Western, described as \"a very witty fellow\", is urging his fellows to hurry through their breakfast, quoting <i>Hamlet </i> and <i>Macbeth</i> among others.",

    "publicComment": "The play is set in Dijon in Burgundy in the later part of the fifteenth century, in the aftermath of the battles of Grandson, Morat (both 1476) and Nancy (1477), all mentioned in Act I, scene ii. The protagonist's father, the elder Charalois, was a general who had gone into debt to pay the expenses of his troops; unable to repay those charges, he died in debtor's prison, and his rapacious creditors refuse to release his body for a proper burial. The general's son has taken his cause to court, but his suit is rejected by the judges, led by the hostile Novall Senior, president of the Dijon parlement. The younger Charalois amazes everyone by offering to assume his father's debts and take his place in prison, thus freeing his father's corpse. A retiring judge named Rochmont is impressed by Charalois' courage, virtue, and self-sacrifice, and decides to pay the general's debts himself. \nRochmont has an only daughter named Beaumelle; she is the centre of a set of fashionable and foppish young people, featuring the aristocratic Novall Junior and his hangers-on. Beaumelle's waiting-woman, Bellapert, is a cynical sensualist who tempts her mistress with the idea of marrying to enjoy sexual indulgence with many illicit lovers. Beaumelle's father is so taken with Charalois that he arranges a marriage between the young man and his daughter. \nNovall Junior is irate about the marriage, since he has lost his chance of taking Beaumelle's virginity; but Bellapert assures him that the marriage will work to his advantage. Others, including Charalois' friend Romont, perceive the growing intimacy of Novall Junior and Beaumelle, and try to warn the parties involved, without success. Eventually, Beaumelle consummates her incipient affair with Novall Junior, and Charalois walks in upon them, catching them in the act. Charalois challenges his wife's lover; Novall Junior attempts to avoid the duel, but in the end he fights with Charalois, and is killed. \nCharalois stages a mock trial, with his father-in-law Rochmont as the judge. Rochmont, even in his emotional turmoil, hears Charalois' accusation and Beaumelle's confession, and sentences her to death. Charalois stabs her; Beaumelle dies. Novall Senior discovers his son's death, and has Charalois arrested and prosecuted. Charalois defends himself before the court, and wins an acquittal. One of Novall Junior's followers, however, is an ex-soldier named Pontalier who was redeemed from debtor's prison by the judge's son; repaying that favour, Pontalier stabs and kills Charalois in the court, and in turn is stabbed and killed by Romont.",

Camillo turns his prisoner over to Hippolito's sister Violetta for safekeeping. Violetta is the object of Camillo's affections; but Fontinelle and Violetta fall in love. Learning of this unwelcome development, Camillo and Hippolito try to tempt Fontinelle to infidelity by sending his portrait to the courtesan Imperia, hoping to interest her in the Frenchman. The ploy fails (at first), and Camillio has Fontinelle thrown into prison. But Fontinelle and Violetta are secretly married. In the last act, however, the Venetians' plotting bears fruit: Fontinelle falls for Imperia, and Violetta has to resort to the standard Elizabethan bed trick</span>",

According to the half-title preceding the poem, in <i>The Works of John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave, Marquis of Normanby [sic], and Duke of Buckingham</i>, 1723, it was written in 1675. Dryden certainly had little share in writing this poem, perhaps no share at all. [...] When the poem was circulated, apparently in manuscript, in 1679, Lord Rochester affected to believe Dryden the author, and in consequence of the attack on himself in lines 230-269 had him assaulted one evening in Rose Alley. [...] Thus the evidence for Dryden's having a share in the authorship of the <i>Essay upon Satire</i> is extremely slender. The ascriptions of authorship in <i>Poems on Affairs of State</i> doubtless rested only on current gossip, and are of no authority.\" Cf. John Dryden. The Poetical Works of Dryden. 2nd ed. Ed. George R. Noyes. Boston: The Riverside Press Cambridge, 1950. 913-16, esp. 913-14; appendix II.",
