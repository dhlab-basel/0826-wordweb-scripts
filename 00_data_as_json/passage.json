Camillo turns his prisoner over to Hippolito's sister Violetta for safekeeping. Violetta is the object of Camillo's affections; but Fontinelle and Violetta fall in love. Learning of this unwelcome development, Camillo and Hippolito try to tempt Fontinelle to infidelity by sending his portrait to the courtesan Imperia, hoping to interest her in the Frenchman. The ploy fails (at first), and Camillio has Fontinelle thrown into prison. But Fontinelle and Violetta are secretly married. In the last act, however, the Venetians' plotting bears fruit: Fontinelle falls for Imperia, and Violetta has to resort to the standard Elizabethan bed trick</span>",

Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\nBear 't that th' oppos\u00e8d may beware of thee.\nGive every man thy ear, but few thy voice.\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man,\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell.
