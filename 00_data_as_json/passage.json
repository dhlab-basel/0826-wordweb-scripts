Whats her haire? faith to Bandora wiars, theres not the like simile: is it likely yet that I am in loue? Whats next? her cheekes, they haue a reasonable scarlet, never a Diars daughter in the towne goes beyond her. Well, yet I am not in loue. Nay, she hath a mole in her cheeke too: Venus mole was not more naturall; but what of that, I am Adonis , and will not loue. Good Venus pardon me. Let vs descend: her chinne, O Helen, Helen , wheres your dimple Helen ? it was your dimple that bewitcht Paris , and without your dimple I will not loue you Helen , No, yet I am safe. Her hand, lettes handle that, I sawe her hand, and it was lilly white, I toucht her palme, and it was soft and smoothe: and then what then? her hand did then bewitch me, I shall be in loue now out of hand. In loue! shall I that euer yet haue prophand loue, now fall to worship him? Shall I that haue ieasted at louers sighes now raise whirlewindes? shall I that haue flowted ay-mees once a quarter, now practise ay-mees euery minute? shal I defie hat-bands, and treade garters and shoostrings vnder my feete? shall I fall to falling bands and be a ruffin no longer? I must; I am now liege man to Cupid , and haue read all these informations in his booke of statutes, the first chapter, page millesimo nono , therefore, hat-band avaunt, ruffe regard your \nselfe, garters adue, shoo-strings so and so; I am a poore enamorate, and enforcde with the Poet to say, Loue orecomes all, and I that loue obey.",

Learning of this unwelcome development, Camillo and Hippolito try to tempt Fontinelle to infidelity by sending his portrait to the courtesan Imperia, hoping to interest her in the Frenchman. The ploy fails (at first), and Camillio has Fontinelle thrown into prison. But Fontinelle and Violetta are secretly married. In the last act, however, the Venetians' plotting bears fruit: Fontinelle falls for Imperia, and Violetta has to resort to the standard Elizabethan bed trick</span>",
