[...] I have the Ability to move my Hand, or to let it rest, that operative Power is indifferent <span class=""quote"">to move, or not to move </span>my Hand: I am then in that respect perfectly free. My <i>Will</i> determines that operative Power to rest, I am yet free, because the <i>indifferency</i> of that my operative Power <span class=""quote"">to act, or not to act, </span>still remains; the Power of moving my Hand, is not at all impair'd by the determination of my <i>Will</i>, which at present orders rest; the <i>indifferency</i> of that Power <span class=""quote"">to act, or not to act, </span>is just as it was before, as will appear, if the <i>Will</i> puts it to the trial, by ordering the contrary. But if during the rest of my Hand, it be seized with a sudden Palsy, the <i>indifferency</i> of that operative Power is gone, and with it my Liberty: I have no longer Freedom in that respect, but am under a Necessity of letting my Hand rest.
