Humanae Miseriae discursus.<br>
O whereof boasteth man, or by what reason<br>
Is filthy clay so much ambitious?<br>
Whose thoughts are vain, and alter every season<br>
Whose deeds are damned, base, and vitious,<br>
Who in his cradle by his childish crying<br>
Presages his mishaps and sorrows denying.<br>
An infant first from nurses tit he sucketh<br>
With nutriment corruption of his nature:<br>
And from the root of endless error plucketh<br>
That taste of sin that waits on every creature,<br>
And as his sinews firm his sin increaseth,<br>
And but till death his sorrow never ceaseth.<br>
In riper years when youthly courage raineth,<br>
A winters blast of fortunes lowring changes,<br>
A flattering hope wherein no trust remaineth,<br>
A fleeting love his forward joy estranges:<br>
Achieve he wealth, with wasteful wo he bought it,<br>
Let substance fail, he grieves, and yet he sought it.<br>
In staled years when as he seeks the gleaning<br>
Of those his times in studious Arts bestowed,<br>
In sum, he oft misconstrueth wise-mens meanings,<br>
Soiling the spring from whence his science flowed,<br>
In all he gains by perfect judgement gained,<br>
A hate of life that hath so long remained.<br>
From height of throne to abject wretchedness,<br>
From wondrous skill to servile ignorance:<br>
From court to cart, from rich to recklessness,<br>
The joys of life have no continuance:<br>
The king, the caitiff wretch, the lay, the learned.<br>
Their crowns, woes, wants, & wits with grief have earned.<br>
The Judgement seat hath brawls, honour is hated,<br>
The soldiers life is daily thrall to danger,<br>
The merchants bag by tempests is abated,<br>
His stock still serves for prey to every stranger,<br>
The scholar with his knowledge learns repent,<br>
Thus each estate in life hath discontent.<br>
And in these trades and choice estates of living,<br>
Youth steals on manly state, and it on age,<br>
And age with weakned limbs, and mind misgiving,<br>
With trembling tongue repenteth youthly rage,<br>
And ere he full hath learned his life to govern,<br>
He dies, and dying doth to dust return.<br>
His greatest good is, to report the trouble<br>
Which he in prime of youth hath overpassed.<br>
How for his grains of good he reapt but stubble,<br>
How lost by love, by follies hew disgraced,<br>
Which whilst he counts, his son perhaps attendeth,<br>
And yet his days in self like follies endeth.<br>
Thus mortal life on sodaine vanisheth.<br>
All like a dream, or as the shadow fleeteth,<br>
When sun his beam from substance banisheth,<br>
Or like the snow at once that dries and sleeteth.<br>
Or as the rainebow which by her condition<br>
Lives by the Sun's reflect and opposition.<br>
Thus life in name is but a death in being,<br>
A burden to the soul by earth entangled:<br>

Herpich, Charles A. ""The source of the 'Seven Ages'."" Notes and Queries, Volume s9-IX, Issue 212 (18 January 1902): 46–47.";"About the walles of the chamber in curious imagerie were the seuen sages of Greece, set forth with their seueral vertues, eloquently discouered in Arabicke verses: The bed appointed for the prince to rest himselfe, was of blacke Ebonie enchased which Rubies, Diamons and Carbunls, made inform of an arch, on which by degrees mans state from infancie to his olde age was plainly depictured, and on the testerne of the bed the whole contents of the same most sagelie desciphered in these verses. <br><br>
Humanae Miseriae discursus.<br>
O whereof boasteth man, or by what reason<br>
Is filthy clay so much ambitious?<br>
Whose thoughts are vaine, and alter euery season▪<br>
Whose deedes are damned, base, and vitious,<br>
Who in his cradle by his childish crying<br>
Presageth his mishaps and sorrowes nying.<br>
An infant first from nurces teat he sucketh<br>
With nutriment corruption of his nature:<br>
And from the roote of endlesse errour plucketh<br>
That taste of sinne that waites on euery creature,<br>
And as his sinewes firme his sinne increaseth,<br>
And but till death his sorrow neuer ceaseth.<br>
In riper yeares when youthly courage raineth,<br>
A winters blast of fortunes lowring changes,<br>
A flattering hope wherein no trust remaineth,<br>
A fleeting loue his forward ioy estranges:<br>
Atchiue he wealth, with wastefull wo he bought it,<br>
Let substance faile, he grieues, and yet he sought it.<br>
In staied yeares when as he seekes the gleaning<br>
Of those his times in studious Artes bestowed,<br>
In summe, he oft misconstrueth wise-mens meanings,<br>
Soiling the spring from whence his science flowed,<br>
In all he gaines by perfect iudgement gained,<br>
A hate of life that hath so long remained.<br>
From height of throne to abiect wretchednesse,<br>
From woonderous skill to seruile ignorance:<br>
From court to cart, from rich to rechlesnesse,<br>
The ioyes of life haue no continuance:<br>
The king, the caitife wretch, the lay, the learned.<br>
Their crowns, woes, wants, & wits with griefe haue erned.<br>
The Iudgement seate hath brawles, honour is hated,<br>
The souldiers life is dayly thrall to danger,<br>
The marchants bag by tempests is abated,<br>
His stocke still serues for prey to euery stranger,<br>
The scholler with his knowledge learnes repent,<br>
Thus each estate in life hath discontent.<br>
And in these trades and choice estates of liuing,<br>
Youth steales on manly state, and it on age,<br>
And age with weakned limmes, and mind misgiuing,<br>
With trembling tongue repenteth youthly rage,<br>
And ere he full hath learnd his life to gouerne,<br>
He dies, and dying doth to dust returne.<br>
His greatest good is, to report the trouble<br>
Which he in prime of youth hath ouerpassed.<br>
How for his graines of good he reapt but stubble,<br>
How lost by loue, by follies hew disgraced,<br>
Which whilst he counts, his sonne perhaps attendeth,<br>
And yet his dayes in selfe like follies endeth.<br>
Thus mortall life on sodaine vanisheth.<br>
All like a dreame, or as the shadow fleeteth,<br>
When sunne his beame from substance banisheth,<br>
Or like the snow at once that dries and sleeteth.<br>
Or as the rainebow which by her condition<br>
Liues by the Sunnes reflect and opposition.<br>
Thus life in name is but a death in beeing,<br>
A burthen to the soule by earth intangled:<br>
Then put thou off that vaile that lets thy seeing,<br>
O wretched man with many torments mangled,<br>
Since neither childe, nor youth, nor staid, nor aged,<br>
The stormes of wretched life may be asswaged.<br>
And with the Egyptian midst thy delicates<br>
Present the shape of death in euery member,<br>
To make thee know the name of all estates:<br>
And midst thy pompe thy nying graue remember,<br>
Which if thou dost, thy pride shall be repressed▪<br>

The protagonist's father, the elder Charalois, was a general who had gone into debt to pay the expenses of his troops; unable to repay those charges, he died in debtor's prison, and his rapacious creditors refuse to release his body for a proper burial. The general's son has taken his cause to court, but his suit is rejected by the judges, led by the hostile Novall Senior, president of the Dijon parlement. The younger Charalois amazes everyone by offering to assume his father's debts and take his place in prison, thus freeing his father's corpse. A retiring judge named Rochmont is impressed by Charalois' courage, virtue, and self-sacrifice, and decides to pay the general's debts himself. 
Rochmont has an only daughter named Beaumelle; she is the centre of a set of fashionable and foppish young people, featuring the aristocratic Novall Junior and his hangers-on. Beaumelle's waiting-woman, Bellapert, is a cynical sensualist who tempts her mistress with the idea of marrying to enjoy sexual indulgence with many illicit lovers. Beaumelle's father is so taken with Charalois that he arranges a marriage between the young man and his daughter. 
Novall Junior is irate about the marriage, since he has lost his chance of taking Beaumelle's virginity; but Bellapert assures him that the marriage will work to his advantage. Others, including Charalois' friend Romont, perceive the growing intimacy of Novall Junior and Beaumelle, and try to warn the parties involved, without success. Eventually, Beaumelle consummates her incipient affair with Novall Junior, and Charalois walks in upon them, catching them in the act. Charalois challenges his wife's lover; Novall Junior attempts to avoid the duel, but in the end he fights with Charalois, and is killed. 
Charalois stages a mock trial, with his father-in-law Rochmont as the judge. Rochmont, even in his emotional turmoil, hears Charalois' accusation and Beaumelle's confession, and sentences her to death. Charalois stabs her; Beaumelle dies. Novall Senior discovers his son's death, and has Charalois arrested and prosecuted. Charalois defends himself before the court, and wins an acquittal. One of Novall Junior's followers, however, is an ex-soldier named Pontalier who was redeemed from debtor's prison by the judge's son; repaying that favour, Pontalier stabs and kills Charalois in the court, and in turn is stabbed and killed by Romont.";"";"@001883 The Fatal Dowry";"";"#002196 A foppish gentleman at his morning toilet";"Unmarked";"Unmarked";"Theatre";"tbe / need to fix biblio and normalised title after transfer";"Dialogue";"Body of text";"Local reference";"Secondary (Annotated edition)";"@010049-245./@010094";"";"";"  Hohl Trillini Regula"
