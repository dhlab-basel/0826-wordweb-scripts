And looking from a turret, might behold <br>
Yong infants swimming in their parents blood, <br>
Headless carcasses piled up in heaps, <br>
Virgins half dead dragged by their golden hair, <br>
And with main force flung on a ring of pikes, <br>
Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides, <br>
Kneeling for mercy to a Greekish lad, <br>
Who with steel Pol-axes dashed out their brains. <br>
Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword, <br>
And thinking to go down, came Hectors ghost <br>
With ashy visage, blueish sulphur eyes, <br>
His arms torn from his shoulders, and his breast <br>
Furrowed with wounds, and that which made me weep, <br>
Thongs at his heels, by which Achilles horse <br>
Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Camp, <br>
Burst from the earth, crying, Aeneas fly, <br>
Troy is a fire, the Grecians hove the town, <br>
[Dido:] O Hector who weeps not to hear thy name? <br>
[Aeneas:] Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life, <br>
Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword <br>
Sent many of their savage ghosts to hell. <br>
At last came Pyrrhus fell and full of fire, <br>
His harness dropping blood, and on his spear<br>
The mangled head of Priams youngest son, <br>
And after him his band of Myrmidons, <br>
With balls of wild fire in their murdering paws, <br>
Which made the funeral flame that burnt fair Troy: <br>
All which hemmed me about, crying, this is he. <br>
[Dido:] Ah, how could poor Aeneas scape their hands? <br>
[Aeneas:] My mother Venus jealous of my health, <br>
Conveyed me from their crooked nets and bands: <br>
So I escaped the furious Pyrrhus wrath: <br>
Who then ran to the palace of the King, <br>
And at Jove's Altar finding Priamus, <br>
About whose withered neck hung Hecuba, <br>
Folding his hand in hers, and jointly both <br>
Beating their breasts and falling on the ground, <br>
He with his falcons point raised up at once, <br>
And with Megaera's eyes stared in their face, <br>
Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance. <br>
To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke: <br>
Achilles son, remember what I was, <br>
Father of fifty sons, but they are slain, <br>
Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turned, <br>
King of this City, but my Troy is fired, <br>
And now am neither father, Lord, nor King: <br>
Yet who so wretched but desires to liue? <br>
O let me live, great Neoptolemus, <br>
Not moved at all, but smiling at his teares, <br>
This butcher whilst his hands were yet held vp, <br>
Treading upon his breast, struck off his hands. <br>
[Dido:] O end Aeneas, I can heare no more. <br>
[Aeneas:] At which the frsntic Queen leapt on his face, <br>
And in his eyelids hanging by the nails, <br>
A little while prolonged her husband's life: <br>
At last the soldiers pulled her by the heels, <br>
And swung her howling in the empty air, <br>
Which sent an echo to the wounded King: <br>
Whereat he lifted up his bed-rid limbs, <br>
And would have grappled with Achilles' son, <br>
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands, <br>
Which he disdaining whisked his sword about, <br>
And with the wound thereof the King fell down: <br>
Then from the navel to the throat at once, <br>
He ripped old Priam: at whose latter gasp <br>
Jove's marble statue 'gan to bend the brow, <br>
As loathing Pyrrhus for this wicked act: <br>
Yet he undaunted took his father's flag, <br>
And dipped it in the old Kings chill cold blood, <br>
And then in triumph ran into the streets, <br>
Through which he could not pass for slaughtered men: <br>
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still, <br>
Viewing the fire where with rich Ilium burnt. <br>
By this I got my father on my back, <br>
This young boy in mine arms, and by the hand <br>
Led fair Creusa my beloved wife, <br>
When thou Achates' with thy sword madst way, <br>
And we were round environed with the Greeks: <br>
O there I lost my wife: and had not we <br>
Fought manfully, I had not told this tale: <br>
Yet manhood would not serve, of force we fled, <br>
And as we went unto our ships, thou knowest <br>
We saw Cassandra sprawling in the streets, <br>
Whom Aiax ravished in Diana's Fawn, <br>
Her cheeks swollen with sighs, her hair all rent, <br>
Whom I took up to bear unto our ships: <br>
But suddenly the Grecians followed vs, <br>
And I alas, was forced to let her lye. <br>
Then got we to our ships, and being abourd, <br>
Polyxena cried out, Aeneas stay, <br>
The Greeks pursue me, stay and take me in. <br>
Moued with her voice, I leapt into the sea, <br>
Thinking to bear her on my back aboard: <br>
For all our ships were launched into the deep, <br>
And as I swam, she standing on the shore, <br>
Was by the cruel Myrmidons surprized, <br>
And after by that Pyrrhus sacrificed. </span>";"";"";"@000820 Dido, Queen of Carthage";"";"NaCa#032238 Venus or Aphrodite / NaCa#032239 Aeneas / NaCa#032240 Dido / CuTi#004083 fire / CuTi#004084 rock or marble (heart) / CuTi#004085 queen or mother / NaMa#004110 Aeneas story of Troy to Dido / CuTi#004182 averted face / NaCa#004214 Priam King of Troy / CuTi#004216 cut-off limb / NaCa#004217 Pyrrhus, Greek warrior / CuTi#004220 wind";"Work by character";"Author unmarked";"Tragedy";"TO BE EDITED";"Dialogue";"BODY OF TEXT";"";"Secondary (Shakespeare Studies)";"@006070";"By this the Campe was come vnto the walles, <br>

At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles, <br>
And swong her howling in the emptie ayre, <br>
Which sent an eccho to the wounded King: <br>
Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims, <br>
And would haue grappeld with Achilles sonne, <br>
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands, <br>
Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about, <br>
And with the wound thereof the King fell downe: <br>
Then from the nauell to the throat at once, <br>
He ript old Priam: at whose latter gaspe <br>
Ioues marble statue gan to bend the brow, <br>
As lothing Pirrhus for this wicked act: <br>
Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge, <br>
And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud, <br>
And then in triumph ran into the streetes, <br>
Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men: <br>
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still, <br>
Viewing the fire where with rich Ilion burnt. <br>
By this I got my father on my backe, <br>
This yong boy in mine armes, and by the hand <br>
Led faire Creusa my beloued wife, <br>
When thou Achates with thy sword mad'st way, <br>
And we were round inuiron'd with the Greekes: <br>
O there I lost my wife: and had not we <br>
Fought manfully, I had not told this tale: <br>
Yet manhood would not serue, of force we fled, <br>
And as we went vnto our ships, thou knowest <br>
We sawe Cassandra sprauling in the streetes, <br>
Whom Aiax rauisht in Dianas Fawne, <br>
Her cheekes swolne with sighes, her haire all rent, <br>
Whom I tooke vp to beare vnto our ships: <br>
But suddenly the Grecians followed vs, <br>
And I alas, was forst to let her lye. <br>
Then got we to our ships, and being abourd, <br>
Polixena cryed out, Æneas stay, <br>
The Greekes pursue me, stay and take me in. <br>
Moued with her voyce, I lept into the sea, <br>
Thinking to beare her on my backe abourd: <br>
For all our ships were launcht into the deepe, <br>
And as I swomme, she standing on the shoare, <br>
Was by the cruell Mirmidons surprizd, <br>
And after by that Pirrhus sacrifizde. ";"Marlowe, Christopher and Thomas Nashe.  ""Dido, Queen of Carthage."" The Complete Plays. Ed. J. B. Steane. London: Penguin 1986. 41-99.  59-62; act 2, scene 1, lines 188-288.";"  Hohl Trillini Regula"
