And bad him into the Peak to dinner <br>
Where never the friend had such a feast <br>
Provided him yet at the charge of a sinner.<br><br>

His stomach was queasy (he came thither coached)<br>
The jogging had made some Crudities rise <br>
To help it he called for a <i>Puritan</i>poached <br>
That used to turn up the eggs of his eyes.<br><br>

And so recovered to his wish <br>
He sat him down and he fell to eat <br>
<i>Promoter in plum broth </i>was his first dish <br>
His own privy kitchen had no such meat.<br><br>

Yet (though with this he much were taken)<br>
Upon a sudden he shifted his trencher,<br>
As soon as he spied the <i>Bawd</i> and <i>Bacon</i><br>
By which you may note the <i>Devil</i>'s a wencher<br><br>

Six pickled tailors sliced and cut <br>
Sempsters tirewomen fit for his palate <br>
With feathermen and perfumers put <br>
Some twelve in a charger to make a grand salad.<br><br>

A rich fat usurer in his marrow <br>
And by him on lawyer's head and green sauce <br>
Both which his belly took in like a barrow <br>
As if till then he never had seen sauce.<br> <br>

Then carbonadoed and cooked with pains <br>
Was brought up a cloven sergeant's face <br>
The sauce was made of a yeomans brains <br>
that had been beaten out with his own mace.<br><br>

Two roasted Sheriffs came whole to the board <br>
The feast had nothing been without 'em <br>
Both living and dead they were foxed and furred <br>
Their chains like sausages hung about 'em.<br><br>

The next dish was the mayor of a town <br>
With a pudding of maintenance thrust in his belly <br>
Like a goose in his feathers dressed in his gown <br>
And his couple of hench-boys boiled to a jelly <br><br>

A London cuckold hot from the spit <br>
And when the carver up had broke him <br>
The devil chopped up his head at a bit <br>
But the horns were very near to choke him <br><br>

Yet though with the meat he was much taken <br>
up on a sudden he shifted his trencher <br>
as soon as he spied the bawd and bacon <br>
by which you may know the devil is a wencher <br><br>

The chin of a lecher too there was roasted <br>
With a plump young harlot's haunch and garlic <br>
A pander's pettitoes that had boasted <br>
Himself for a captain yet never was warlike <br><br>

A lusty fat pasty of a midwife hot <br>
And for a cold baked meat into the story <br>
A reverend painted lady was brought <br>
Was coffined in crust till she was hoary <br><br>

To these an overgrown justice of peace <br>
With a clerk like a gizzard trussed under each arm <br>
And warrant for sippets laid in his own grease <br>
Set over a chafing-dish to be kept warm <br><br>

The jowl of a jailor served for fish <br>
A constable soused with vinegar by <br>
Two aldermen lobsters asleep in a dish <br>
A deputy tart and a churchwarden pie <br><br>

All which devoured he then for a close <br>
Did for a full draught of Derby call <br>
He heaved the huge vessel up to his nose <br>
And left not till he had drunk up all.<br><br>

Then from the table he gave a start <br>
Where banquet and wine was nothing scarce <br>
All which he blew away with a fart <br>
From whence it was called the <i>Devil's Arse.</i></span>";"";"#009027 Marquess of Buckingham's household / #008027 RUTLAND_Burley-on-the-Hill";"@001987_A21_D40 The Gypsies Metamorphosed";"";"WoPa#004352 Cook Lawrick invited the devil / NaHu_NewWot#007019 Jonson, Ben";"Work unmarked";"Author unmarked";"Masque or other";"";"Dialogue";"BODY OF TEXT";"";"Scholarly database";"@006121-Last accessed 23 September 2019.";"";"";"   Hohl Regula"
