And through the breach did march into the streets, <br>
Where meeting with the rest, kill kill they cried. <br>
Frighted with this confused noise, I rose, <br>
And looking from a turret, might behold <br>
Yong infants swimming in their parents blood, <br>
Headless carcasses piled up in heaps, <br>
Virgins half dead dragged by their golden hair, <br>
And with main force flung on a ring of pikes, <br>
Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides, <br>
Kneeling for mercy to a Greekish lad, <br>
Who with steel Pol-axes dashed out their brains. <br>
Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword, <br>
And thinking to go down, came Hectors ghost <br>
With ashy visage, blueish sulphur eyes, <br>
His arms torn from his shoulders, and his breast <br>
Furrowed with wounds, and that which made me weep, <br>
Thongs at his heels, by which Achilles horse <br>
Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Camp, <br>
Burst from the earth, crying, Aeneas fly, <br>
Troy is a fire, the Grecians hove the town, <br>
[Dido:] O Hector who weeps not to hear thy name? <br>
[Aeneas:] Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life, <br>
Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword <br>
Sent many of their savage ghosts to hell. <br>
At last came Pyrrhus fell and full of fire, <br>
His harness dropping blood, and on his spear<br>
The mangled head of Priams youngest son, <br>
And after him his band of Myrmidons, <br>
With balls of wild fire in their murdering paws, <br>
Which made the funeral flame that burnt fair Troy: <br>
All which hemmed me about, crying, this is he. <br>
[Dido:] Ah, how could poor Aeneas scape their hands? <br>
[Aeneas:] My mother Venus jealous of my health, <br>
Conveyed me from their crooked nets and bands: <br>
So I escaped the furious Pyrrhus wrath: <br>
Who then ran to the palace of the King, <br>
And at Jove's Altar finding Priamus, <br>
About whose withered neck hung Hecuba, <br>
Folding his hand in hers, and jointly both <br>
Beating their breasts and falling on the ground, <br>
He with his falcons point raised up at once, <br>
And with Megaera's eyes stared in their face, <br>
Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance. <br>
To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke: <br>
Achilles son, remember what I was, <br>
Father of fifty sons, but they are slain, <br>
Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turned, <br>
King of this City, but my Troy is fired, <br>
And now am neither father, Lord, nor King: <br>
Yet who so wretched but desires to liue? <br>
O let me live, great Neoptolemus, <br>
Not moved at all, but smiling at his teares, <br>
This butcher whilst his hands were yet held vp, <br>
Treading upon his breast, struck off his hands. <br>
[Dido:] O end Aeneas, I can heare no more. <br>
[Aeneas:] At which the frsntic Queen leapt on his face, <br>
And in his eyelids hanging by the nails, <br>
A little while prolonged her husband's life: <br>
At last the soldiers pulled her by the heels, <br>
And swung her howling in the empty air, <br>
Which sent an echo to the wounded King: <br>
Whereat he lifted up his bed-rid limbs, <br>
And would have grappled with Achilles' son, <br>
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands, <br>
Which he disdaining whisked his sword about, <br>
And with the wound thereof the King fell down: <br>
Then from the navel to the throat at once, <br>
He ripped old Priam: at whose latter gasp <br>
Jove's marble statue 'gan to bend the brow, <br>
As loathing Pyrrhus for this wicked act: <br>
Yet he undaunted took his father's flag, <br>
And dipped it in the old Kings chill cold blood, <br>
And then in triumph ran into the streets, <br>
Through which he could not pass for slaughtered men: <br>
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still, <br>
Viewing the fire where with rich Ilium burnt. <br>
By this I got my father on my back, <br>
This young boy in mine arms, and by the hand <br>
Led fair Creusa my beloved wife, <br>
When thou Achates' with thy sword madst way, <br>
And we were round environed with the Greeks: <br>
O there I lost my wife: and had not we <br>
Fought manfully, I had not told this tale: <br>
Yet manhood would not serve, of force we fled, <br>
And as we went unto our ships, thou knowest <br>
We saw Cassandra sprawling in the streets, <br>
Whom Aiax ravished in Diana's Fawn, <br>
Her cheeks swollen with sighs, her hair all rent, <br>
Whom I took up to bear unto our ships: <br>
But suddenly the Grecians followed vs, <br>
And I alas, was forced to let her lye. <br>
Then got we to our ships, and being abourd, <br>
Polyxena cried out, Aeneas stay, <br>
The Greeks pursue me, stay and take me in. <br>
Moued with her voice, I leapt into the sea, <br>
Thinking to bear her on my back aboard: <br>
For all our ships were launched into the deep, <br>
And as I swam, she standing on the shore, <br>
Was by the cruel Myrmidons surprized, <br>
And after by that Pyrrhus sacrificed. </span>";"";"";"@000820 Dido, Queen of Carthage";"";"NaCa#032238 Venus or Aphrodite / NaCa#032239 Aeneas / NaCa#032240 Dido / CuTi#004083 fire / CuTi_NatLan#004084 rock or marble (heart) / CuTi#004085 queen or mother / NaMa#004110 Aeneas story of Troy to Dido / CuTi#004182 averted face / NaCa#004214 Priam King of Troy / CuTi#004216 cut-off limb / NaCa_CulWar#004217 Pyrrhus, Greek warrior / CuTi_NatSky#004220 wind";"Work by character";"Author unmarked";"Tragedy";"";"Dialogue";"BODY OF TEXT";"";"Secondary (Academic_Shakespeare)";"@006070";"By this the Campe was come vnto the walles, <br>

[Dido:] O Hector who weepes not to heare thy name? <br>
[Aeneas:] Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life, <br>
Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword <br>
Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell. <br>
At last came Pirrhus fell and full ofire, <br>
His harnesse dropping bloud, and on his speare <br>
The mangled head of Priams yongest sonne, <br>
And after him his band of Mirmidons, <br>
With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes, <br>
Which made the funerall flame that burnt faire Troy: <br>
All which hemd me about, crying, this is he. <br>
[Dido:] Ah, how could poore Aeneas scape their hands? <br>
[Aeneas:] My mother Venus iealous of my health, <br>
Conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands: <br>
So I escapt the furious Pirrhus wrath: <br>
Who then ran to the pallace of the King, <br>
And at Ioues Altar finding Priamus, <br>
About whose withered necke hung Hecuba, <br>
Foulding his hand in hers, and ioyntly both <br>
Beating their breasts and falling on the ground, <br>
He with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once, <br>
And with Megeras eyes stared in their face, <br>
Threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce. <br>
To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke: <br>
Achilles sonne, remember what I was, <br>
Father of fiftie sonnes, but they are slaine, <br>
Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turnd, <br>
King of this Citie, but my Troy is fired, <br>
And now am neither father, Lord, nor King: <br>
Yet who so wretched but desires to liue? <br>
O let me liue, great Neoptolemus, <br>
Not mou'd at all, but smiling at his teares, <br>
This butcher whil'st his hands were yet held vp, <br>
Treading vpon his breast, strooke off his hands. <br>
[Dido:] O end Æneas, I can heare no more. <br>
[Aeneas:] At which the franticke Queene leapt on his face, <br>
And in his eyelids hanging by the nayles, <br>
A little while prolong'd her husbands life: <br>
At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles, <br>
And swong her howling in the emptie ayre, <br>
Which sent an eccho to the wounded King: <br>
Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims, <br>
And would haue grappeld with Achilles sonne, <br>
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands, <br>
Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about, <br>
And with the wound thereof the King fell downe: <br>
Then from the nauell to the throat at once, <br>
He ript old Priam: at whose latter gaspe <br>
Ioues marble statue gan to bend the brow, <br>
As lothing Pirrhus for this wicked act: <br>
Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge, <br>
And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud, <br>
And then in triumph ran into the streetes, <br>
Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men: <br>
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still, <br>
Viewing the fire where with rich Ilion burnt. <br>
By this I got my father on my backe, <br>
This yong boy in mine armes, and by the hand <br>
Led faire Creusa my beloued wife, <br>
When thou Achates with thy sword mad'st way, <br>
And we were round inuiron'd with the Greekes: <br>
O there I lost my wife: and had not we <br>
Fought manfully, I had not told this tale: <br>
Yet manhood would not serue, of force we fled, <br>
And as we went vnto our ships, thou knowest <br>
We sawe Cassandra sprauling in the streetes, <br>
Whom Aiax rauisht in Dianas Fawne, <br>
Her cheekes swolne with sighes, her haire all rent, <br>
Whom I tooke vp to beare vnto our ships: <br>
But suddenly the Grecians followed vs, <br>
And I alas, was forst to let her lye. <br>
Then got we to our ships, and being abourd, <br>
Polixena cryed out, Æneas stay, <br>
The Greekes pursue me, stay and take me in. <br>
Moued with her voyce, I lept into the sea, <br>
Thinking to beare her on my backe abourd: <br>
For all our ships were launcht into the deepe, <br>
And as I swomme, she standing on the shoare, <br>
Was by the cruell Mirmidons surprizd, <br>
And after by that Pirrhus sacrifizde. ";"Marlowe, Christopher and Thomas Nashe.  ""Dido, Queen of Carthage."" The Complete Plays. Ed. J. B. Steane. London: Penguin 1986. 41-99.  59-62; act 2, scene 1, lines 188-288.";"  Hohl Regula"

1 Cock Lorel would needs have the devil his guest <br>
And bad him into the Peak to dinner <br>
Where never the friend had such a feast <br>
provided yet at the cost of a sinner <br>
<br>
2 His stomacke was queasy he came thither coached <br>
The jogging had made some crudities rise <br>
To help it he called for a puritan poached <br>
That used to turn up the eggs off his eyes <br>
<br>
3 And so recovered to his wish <br>
He sat him down and he fell to eat <br>
Promoter in plum broth was his first dish <br>
His own privy kitchen had no such meat <br>
<br>
4 Six pickled tailors sliced and cut <br>
Sempsters tirewomen fit for his palate <br>
With feathermen and perfumers put <br>
Some twelve in a charger to make a grand sallat <br>
<br>
5 A rich fat usurer in his marrow <br>
And by him on lawyer's and green sauce <br>
Both with his belly took in like a barrow <br>
As if till then he never had seen sauce <br>
<br>
6 Then carbonadoed and cooked with pains <br>
Was brought up a cloven sergeant's face <br>
The sauce was made of a yeomans brains <br>
that had been cloven out with his own mace <br>
<br>
7 Two roasted sheriffs came whole to the board <br>
The feast had nothing been without 'em <br>
Both living and dead they were foxed and furred <br>
Their chains like sausages hung about 'em <br>
<br>
8 The next dish was the mayor of a town <br>
With a pudding of maintenance thrust in his belly <br>
Like a goose in his feathers dressed in his gown <br>
And his couple of hench-boys boiled to a jelly <br>
<br>
9 A London cuckold hot from the spit <br>
And when the carver up had broke him <br>
The devil chopped up his head at a bit <br>
Both horns were very near to choke him <br>
<br>
10 Yet though with the meat he was much taken <br>
up on a sudden he shifted his trencher <br>
as soon as he spied the bawd and bacon <br>
by which you may know the devil is a wencher <br>
<br>
11 The chin of a lecher too there was roasted <br>
With a plump young harlot's haunch and garlic <br>
A pander's pettitoes that had boasted <br>
Himself for a captain yet never was warlike <br>
<br>
12 A lusty fat pasty of a midwife hot <br>
And for a cold baked meat into the story <br>
A reverend painted lady was brought <br>
Was coffined in crust till she was hoary <br>
<br>
13 To these an overgrowne justice of peace <br>
With a clerk like a gizzard trussed under each arm <br>
And warrant for sippets laid in his own grease <br>
Set over a chafing-dish to be kept warm <br>
<br>
14 The jowl of a jailor served for fish <br>
A constable soused with vinegar by <br>
Two aldermen lobsters asleep in a dish <br>
A deputy tart and a churchwarden pie <br>
<br>
15 All which devoured he then for a close <br>
Did for a full draught of Derby call <br>
He heaved the huge vessel up to his nose <br>
and left not till he had drunk up all <br>
<br>
16 Then from the table he gave a start <br>
Where banquet and wine was nothing scarce <br>
All which he blew away with a fart <br>
From whence it was called the Devil's Arse.</span>";"";"#009027 Marquess of Buckingham's household / #008027 RUTLAND_Burley-on-the-Hill";"@001987 The Gypsies Metamorphosed";"";"VeSp#004352 Cook Lawrick invited the devil his guest ";"Work unmarked";"Author unmarked";"Masque or other";"TO BE EDITED";"Dialogue";"BODY OF TEXT";"";"Secondary (Scholarly database_Literature)";"@006121-Last accessed 23 September 2019.";"";"";"  Hohl Regula"
