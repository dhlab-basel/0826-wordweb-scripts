Neither a borrower nor a lender be,<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>

According to the half-title preceding the poem, in <i>The Works of John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave, Marquis of Normanby [sic], and Duke of Buckingham</i>, 1723, it was written in 1675. Dryden certainly had little share in writing this poem, perhaps no share at all. [...] When the poem was circulated, apparently in manuscript, in 1679, Lord Rochester affected to believe Dryden the author, and in consequence of the attack on himself in lines 230-269 had him assaulted one evening in Rose Alley. [...] Thus the evidence for Dryden's having a share in the authorship of the <i>Essay upon Satire</i> is extremely slender. The ascriptions of authorship in <i>Poems on Affairs of State</i> doubtless rested only on current gossip, and are of no authority."" Cf. John Dryden. The Poetical Works of Dryden. 2nd ed. Ed.
