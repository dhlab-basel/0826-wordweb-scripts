The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with thee.
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
Bear 't that th' opposèd may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee.

According to the half-title preceding the poem, in <i>The Works of John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave, Marquis of Normanby [sic], and Duke of Buckingham</i>, 1723, it was written in 1675. Dryden certainly had little share in writing this poem, perhaps no share at all. [...] When the poem was circulated, apparently in manuscript, in 1679, Lord Rochester affected to believe Dryden the author, and in consequence of the attack on himself in lines 230-269 had him assaulted one evening in Rose Alley. [...] Thus the evidence for Dryden's having a share in the authorship of the <i>Essay upon Satire</i> is extremely slender.
