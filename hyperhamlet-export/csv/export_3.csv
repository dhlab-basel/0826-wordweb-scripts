Little would you think there were a couple of starres in these two augur-holes: or that this pit had been arch'd over with a handsome nose, that had been at the charges to maintain half a dozen of severall silver arches to uphold the bridge. It had been a mighty favour once, <span class=""quote"">to have kiss'd these lips that grin so. </span>This mouth out of all the Madams boxes cannot now be furnished with a set of teeth.

Will all her perrukes, tyres and dresses, with her chargeable teeth, with her cerusse and pomatum, and the benefit of her painter and doctor, make this idol up again?<br>
