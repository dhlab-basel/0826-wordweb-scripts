If it be true, Socrates continues, \"that death is a departure into these regions, which all they inhabite, that are departed out of this life\", then \"this ought to seem a sweet pilgrimage\" (1.41.98; Sig.

For if at the last day of our life, our souls die not, but only change their place, what ought we more to wish? But if death do utterly destroy us, what can be better, than in the rage of great storms, sweetly to slumber? and after that a man hath nodded out of this life, to sleep everlastingly.(1.49.117; Sig.

The ploy fails (at first), and Camillio has Fontinelle thrown into prison. But Fontinelle and Violetta are secretly married.
