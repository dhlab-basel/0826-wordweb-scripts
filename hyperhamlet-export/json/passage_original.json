If valour, talke of your sword, and be frequent in the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting If actiuitie, be seene o'your barbary often, or leaping ouer stooles, for the credit of your back.

Seeme as you would giue, but be like a barren field that yeelds little, or vnlucky dice, to foolish, and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts be slight, and daintie, rather then pretious.

Admire her tyres; like her in all fashions; compare her in euery habit to some deitie; inuent excellent dreames to flatter her, and riddles, or, if shee bee a great one, performe alwaies the second parts to her: like what shee likes, praise [100]  whom she praises, and faile not to make the houshold and seruants yours, yea the whole family, and salute 'hem by their names: ('tis but light cost if you can purchase 'hem so) and make her physitian your pensioner, and her chiefe woman.
